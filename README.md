# Cadvance

Cadvance is a research-driven project that integrates **biological, environmental, and lifestyle factors** to assess and advance human health insights. It focuses on combining **cortisol levels, telomere length, and biological age** with **environmental and lifestyle metrics** to provide a holistic view of wellness and aging.

## Features
- **Multi-Factor Health Analysis**: Combines key biomarkers (cortisol, telomeres, biological age) with environmental and lifestyle data.
- **Data Visualization**: Quad charts, flowcharts, and clean result visualizations for actionable insights.
- **Modular Framework**: Easily extendable for additional biomarkers and metrics.
- **Evidence-Based**: Backed by scientific literature and validated methods.

## Methodology
1. **Biological Inputs**: Cortisol levels (stress), telomere length (cellular aging), biological age estimation.
2. **Environmental Inputs**: Pollution, climate, and surrounding conditions.
3. **Lifestyle Inputs**: Diet, exercise, sleep, and daily routines.
4. **Integration**: Weighted analysis to determine overall health and aging trajectory.

## Results
- Provides **individual and population-level assessments**.
- Generates **visual summaries** (quad charts, comparative graphs).
- Supports **preventive strategies** for long-term health optimization.

## Use Cases
- **Research & Academia**: For studies on aging, stress, and environmental health.
- **Healthcare Professionals**: As a framework to evaluate patient lifestyle impacts.
- **Policy Development**: For creating health policies incorporating environmental/lifestyle factors.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (or Plotly for visualization)
- **Documentation**: Markdown, LaTeX (for scientific papers)

## Future Scope
- Incorporation of **genetic and epigenetic data**.
- **AI-driven predictive modeling** for early risk detection.
- **Mobile/Cloud Integration** for real-time health tracking.
